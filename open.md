Sorting Algorithm with User Input Feature

In this contribution, I enhanced a Java sorting algorithm by adding functionality to take user input for the array elements. 
This makes the program more dynamic, allowing users to specify their data directly through the console. 
Additionally, I updated the import statements for better code optimization and readability.

Features Added:

Added support for user input to customize the array being sorted.
Improved the import structure to streamline the code.
This update provides a more interactive and efficient sorting experience for users.
